This is a simple project which we are using a modal :

    1.In the home there will be a button to create account

        this will take you to a page handle using django

    2.When clicking the 'open modal' button modal appears fill the form submit it

    3.If successfull will redirect to page1
    
    4.If error will show the modal with errors
